Software Engineering Day1 Assignment
#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
is a branch of computer science used for developing, testing and maintaining software.

    importance
  -> Security - software engineering is a key aspect in the security industry. Software engineers use secure coding practices, vulnerability testing, and encryption techniques to ensure that software is secure against hacking attempts and data breaches and protecting software from cyber threats.
  -> Software engineering enhances collaboration and communication among people involedeither in the creation of the software that is developers via the git version control and the users of the software and also between the project managers and stake holders.
  -> Software engineering is essential in time and cost efficiency for software development as it enhances proper methodologies being involved during designing and sticking to the timeline. This enhances trust of the stake holder and proper development strategies.
  -> Maintainability of the software. Software engineering is essential in the maintainability of software based on the technological advancements that are experienced with time and thus making software user friendly and maintaining software usage trust.
  -> Software engineering enhances quality and reliability of the software hence essential in the technology industry.
  -> Scalability and smooth software performance is met with software engineering as technology advances day in day out hence essential in the making of scalable solutions.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
  Mastering complexity (1960s -1970s) -> Due to evolvement of logical structures such as loops and funcions that replaced the initial "spaghetti code" that was complex. This lead to better readability and emergence of more user friendly programming languages and made debugging easy.
  Mastering process (1970s - 1980s) -> The waterfall model that was introduced by Winston Royce was one of the software development processes. This led to splitting software development life cycle into distinct phases: requirements, design, implementation, testing and designing. 
  Mastering Machine (1980s) -> This was the start and evolving of Object Oriented Programming it intoduced cases like objects classes , inheritance and polymorphism.  Languages like Java and C++ gained popularity. This was the foundation to modern software and frameworks.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
 . planning -> Idenitfying the requirements and purpose for the development.
 . Requirement analysis -> identify the final user specification.
 . Design -> Building the software framework.
 . Coding -> putting the design into code using programming language.
 . Testing -> examining the code for any bags and debugging them.
 . Maintenance -> Maintaining the software and Improvements on the software.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
  Waterfall Methodology -> involves linear and sequential and development is divided into distinct phases. Testing is done after development. It is difficult to make changes since the phases have to be all completed and hence low flexibility. They best used for small projects that are well defined and are also used in regulated industries where strict infomation is required.
                              while
  Agile methodology -> involves incremental and iterative approach and projects are divided into simple manageable chunks called sprints. Testing is continuous after every iteration. High flexibility and adapts easily to the changes made. Is best used for projects with evolving requirements and may also be used in innovative projects.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
      Roles of software developer.
    . Developing applications and programs using programming languages for well defined problems.
    . Maintaining and updating software to keep it functional.
    . Collaborating with other team members to ensure best practice when developing software.
    . Reporting to the project manager concerning the software development.

      Quality Assurance Engineer
    . Ensuring that the software meets the required requirements before deployment of the software.
    . Colaborate with stake holders to understand the requirements of software.
    . Create development standards and procedures for the programmers to follow.
    . Develop and execute automation scripts using open source tools.
    . Analyse the product to identify bugs and suggest changes to make them more efficient.
    
      Project Manager.
    . Create blueprint to the project.
    . Discuss the project requirements with the clients and software developers.
    . Assembles and leads the software team .
    . Tracking and providing communication on the projects milestones.
    . Deliver the complete software to the client and regularly checking its performance.
    
Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
  -> IDE enhances developers and programmers to write codes. For example IDE has catalogued tools that help developers to write their progam codes as it has inbuilt feature extensions for different programming languages hence making development simple.
  -> IDE enhances code debugging. IDE has inbuilt debug feature that debugs and error that may be either compilation, runtime or logical error hence making it easier for program debugging.
  -> IDE provides an interface for code testing during program development stage hence making it easier to perform read and write operations and testing the code. for example IDE has code runner extension that can be used to run the code program written by a developer.
  -> COntrol version IDE has git extensions that are connected to git hence important in version control.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
    .Time Constraints - Software engineering is a demanding and time-intensive field, often requiring engineers to work under high pressure to       meet tight deadlines.
     Strategy: adopt agile methodologies, such as Scrum, to streamline workflows by dividing large projects into manageable sprints 

    . Software Accessibility and Usability - Overly complex software can frustrate or confuse users. 
    strategy: Use scalable architecture, Emphasize reliability.

    . Tight Deadlines -> Unrealistic deadlines can lead to rushed work, poor quality, and burnout.
    Strategy: Break the project into smaller, manageable tasks with clear priorities.

    . Communication Gaps-> Miscommunication between team members, stakeholders, or departments can lead to misunderstandings and errors.
    Strategies:Use collaboration tools (e.g., Slack, Microsoft Teams) for clear communication.
    Hold regular meetings (e.g., daily stand-ups, sprint reviews) to align everyone.

    . Debugging and Testing-> Identifying and fixing bugs can be time-consuming and frustrating.
    Strategies:Write unit tests and integration tests to catch issues early.
    Use debugging tools and techniques (e.g., breakpoints, logging).

    . Security Vulnerabilities-> Software is often vulnerable to security threats, such as hacking or data breaches.
    Strategies:Follow secure coding practices (e.g., input validation, encryption).

    skills sharp in an ever-evolving industry. - Programmers should also remain updated on the technological advancements.



Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
  Units -> are close to the source application.They consist in testing individual methods and functions of the classes, components, or modules used by your software. it ensures that each unit performs its intended function correctly, isolated from other components.
   Integration tests - verify that different modules or services used by your application work well together. Help to ensure data flows smoothly between modules and interfaces work as expected.
  System testing -Focus on the entire software system as a whole, including all functionalities and interactions.
 It help to verify that the system meets all functional and non-functional requirements, including performance, usability, and    security .
   Acceptance tests - are formal tests that verify if a system satisfies business requirements. They require the entire application to be running while testing and focus on replicating user behaviors. 


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
  Prompt engineering refers to instructing AI to provide related information as asked.
    importance
  -> Maximizing accuracy and relevance when using AI models hence important in getting accurate and content specific results.
  -> Providing information to the target audience hence providing contextualixed information to the target audience hence improving user           reliability to the ai models.
  -> Prompt engineering is essential in problem solving and creativity.
  -> Prompt engineering is essential in avoiding abuiguity and misinterpretations since we are encouraged not to use vaguous statements.
  -> Prompt engineering is essential in maximizing online resources and features to enhance innovative and making ideas clear.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
      Create a program for health management system.
Improved Prompt:--> "Develop a cloud-based health management system for hospitals to manage patient records, appointments, and prescriptions. The system should allow doctors to access patient histories, schedule appointments, and prescribe medications electronically. It should also include a patient portal where users can view their medical records, book appointments, and receive reminders. The system must comply with HIPAA regulations, be built using Python (Django) for the backend, and have a React-based frontend. The project should be completed within 9 months."
